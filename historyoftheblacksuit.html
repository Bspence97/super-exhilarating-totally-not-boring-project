  The black suit Spiderman wears was originally conceptualized by
  a fan named Randy Schueller in 1982. In Secret Wars #8, Spidey
  mistakes a mysterious black substance for Reed Richards's costume
  creator and it immediately takes hold of him. He did not know it
  at the time, but this was an alien symbiote. This new suit comes with
  a host of new abilities including increased strength and the ability
  for it to produce its own webbing.

Amazing Spiderman 258 saw Peter trying to break away from the suit as
it is revealed by Reed Richards that the suit is actually eating his brain.
The classic and black suit both fight for domninance and it is ultimately the
classic suit that wins. However after taking it off, Black Cat gives him
a fabric version of the suit. Below we can see the bad news:
